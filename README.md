##INTRODUCTION 

Intelligent Alert System for Forest Tribal People Using IBM Watson Studio. This project aims to save the lives of tribal by notifying about wildlife predation with the help of Artificial Intelligence.Tribal people constitute 8.6% of the nation's total population, and most of them spend the greater part of their lives in the proximity of trees and villages or clans near to the forest. There are so many challenges faced by these people out of which Human-wildlife conflict   is a serious challenge undermining the protection of tribal regions. The major types of human-wildlife conflict in the area include crop-raiding, livestock predation, increased risk of livestock diseases, and direct threats to human life. so Active measures are to be implemented to mitigate these problems and safeguard the future of the wildlife. Hence, we came up with this Project “Intelligent Alert System”. This ensures the complete safety of humans who lives near the forests by notifying the wild animal predation before it enters the clan.
